1. **Traversal**: Using the following methods:
   - `for` loop
   - `while`
   - `do-while`
   - `for...of`
   - `for...in`
   - `forEach`
   - `filter`
   - `map`
   - `reduce`
   - Spread
   - `every`
   - `some`

2. **Insertion**: Using:
   - `push`
   - `unshift`
   - Spread operator
   - `concat`
   - `splice`

3. **Deletion**: Using:
   - `pop`
   - `shift`
   - `splice`
   - `delete` operator

4. **Searching**: Using:
   - `find`
   - `findIndex`
   - `some`
   - `every`
   - `lastIndexOf`

5. **Sorting**: Using:
   - `sort()`
   - `toSorted`
   - Bubble sort

## 12/12/24: Stack Operations
1. Implemented Stack using Array to perform:
   - `push`
   - `pop`
   - `peek`

2. Implemented Stack using Constructor to perform operations like:
   - `push`
   - `pop`
   - `peek`
   - `isEmpty`
   - `size`

## 13/12/24 and 16/12/24: Stack Problems
1. Covered various problems, such as:
   - Reverse a stack
   - Sort a stack
   - Find largest and second-largest elements in a stack etc.

## 18/12/24: Queue Operations
1. Implemented Queue using Array:
   - Performed `push`, `pop`, and `peek`
2. Implemented Queue using Linked List
3. Implemented Priority Queue

## 19/12/24 and 20/12/24: Linked Lists
**Implemented Singly,doubly and circular Linked List**
1. Singly Linked List:
   - Operations: `addFirst`, `addLast`, `addAt`, `addAtMiddle`, `removeFirst`, `removeLast`, `removeAt`, `reverse`, `sort`, `remove duplicate`
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Linked List

## 23/12/24: Trees and Binary Search Trees (BST)
1. Basics of Trees and BST
2. Implemented Binary Search Tree with operations:
   - `insert`
   - `search`
   - `delete`
3. Questions on Binary Search Tree:
   - Performed Traversals:
     - Inorder Traversal
     - Preorder Traversal
     - Postorder Traversal
   - Finding the height of a Binary Tree
   - Check if a tree is a valid BST etc.

## 24/12/24 and 26/12/24: Graphs

1. Basics: Covered graph terminologies like nodes, edges, vertices, connected/weighted/acyclic graphs, walks, and paths.
2. Representation: Used adjacency matrix and adjacency list.
3. Implementation: Built graphs using both representations

## 8/01/25, 9/01/25 and 10/01/25: Advance JS Topics 
1. Basics Of Object and classes: 
    - Covered object creation, modification, and methods like .freeze() and .seal().
2. Explored shallow/deep copying, prototype inheritance, and extending built-in classes.
3. Implemented concepts like optional chaining, property flags, getters, setters, and object-to-primitive conversion.
  

## 13/01/25 and 14/01/25: Promises and Advanced Topics 

1. Promises: Covered promise states, chaining, and APIs like allSettled and race.
2. Async/Await: Learned its importance and implemented solutions with error handling.
3. Closures, Decorators, and Proxy Functions: Explored advanced use cases.
4. Other Topics: Covered currying, generators, callbacks, microtasks, Reflect API, and hoisting.
